  The table reporter provides a simple tabular representation of memory
  allocations, for memory that was leaked during the tracking period
  (i.e. allocated and not deallocated).

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  Note that the Python allocator doesn't necessarily release memory to
  the system when Python objects are deallocated and these can still
  appear as "leaks". If you want to exclude these, you can run your
  application with the `PYTHONMALLOC=malloc` environment variable set.

<p>
  The table reporter provides a simple tabular representation of memory
  allocations in the target <b>when the memory usage was at its peak</b>.
